# Accessibility

This starter targets **WCAG 2.2 Level AA**. Accessibility is treated as a default, not a phase — every component ships accessible-by-default and every PR is gated against regressions.

## What's wired by default

- **Skip-to-main-content link** on every page ([+layout.svelte](../src/routes/+layout.svelte)).
- **Focus-managed `<main>`** with `tabindex="-1"` so route changes can move focus into content.
- **Accessible primitives** for the patterns most likely to ship a11y bugs:
  - [Accordion](../src/lib/components/Accordion.svelte) — disclosure pattern with `aria-expanded`, `aria-controls`, `aria-labelledby`.
  - [Modal](../src/lib/components/Modal.svelte) — native `<dialog>` with backdrop, ESC-to-close, and implicit focus trap.
  - [Slider](../src/lib/components/Slider.svelte) — `aria-roledescription="carousel"`, per-slide controls with `aria-current`.
  - [Form / Field](../src/lib/components/Form.svelte) — every input has a programmatic label, required fields announce "(required)" to screen readers, errors link via `aria-describedby` and surface in a focused error summary.
- **`prefers-reduced-motion` honored** in animation primitives ([animateIn.ts:51](../src/lib/actions/animateIn.ts#L51)) — users with the OS preference get no transform, no transition, immediate reveal.
- **Compiler-level a11y warnings** via Svelte's built-in checks (run on `pnpm lint`).

Run locally:

```bash
pnpm verify           # everything CI runs, in CI's order
pnpm test:unit        # vitest unit tests
pnpm test:smoke       # Playwright + axe (boots vite dev)
pnpm test:a11y        # the fleet a11y audit CI gates on
pnpm dlx @lhci/cli autorun   # Lighthouse against lighthouserc.json — manual, not in CI
```

## Manual testing reference

Automated tooling (axe, the fleet a11y audit, the Svelte compiler) catches the bulk of WCAG violations on every code change. Manual passes aren't part of the standard build. If a client reports an issue or an external audit identifies a gap, these are the checks worth running to reproduce and confirm fixes:

- Keyboard-only navigation through every interactive element, including tab order, visible focus rings, and trap-free modals
- Screen reader pass with VoiceOver (macOS / iOS) and NVDA (Windows / Firefox)
- 200% browser zoom — no clipped content or horizontal scroll
- Windows High Contrast mode — borders, focus rings, and form errors remain visible
- Reduced-motion OS setting — no animation plays
- Color contrast: 4.5:1 on body text, 3:1 on UI components and large text

## Adding new accessible components

1. **Start from a native element** when one exists (`<button>`, `<dialog>`, `<details>`). Re-implementing them in `<div>`s is the #1 source of a11y bugs.
2. **Add the component to `/dev/a11y-fixtures`** so the axe gate covers it.
3. **Pair label + input** with `for`/`id` on every form control (Field handles this).
4. **Don't trap focus accidentally** — only modals/popovers should trap. Everything else should let Tab continue out.
5. **Mark errors with `role="alert"` and `aria-live="polite"`** so screen readers announce them when they appear.

## Accessibility statement

Public-sector and education clients should publish an accessibility statement at `/accessibility`, naming the conformance target (WCAG 2.2 AA), known gaps, and a contact route for reporting barriers. No template ships here — write it against the site's actual audit results, since a statement that overclaims is worse than none.

## Reporting issues

Treat accessibility regressions as P1 bugs. They block merges to `main`.
